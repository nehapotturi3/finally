This HTML code creates a clean and modern web page that helps users install your app in different ways. It includes:

* ✅ **Google Play and App Store buttons** – so users on Android or iOS can install your app from the official stores.
* 🌐 **PWA Install button** – if your website is a Progressive Web App, users will see a button to install it directly to their device (like a real app).
* 🎨 A simple, responsive design that looks good on phones, tablets, or desktops.
* 🧠 Smart JavaScript that shows the PWA install button only when it's supported by the browser.
